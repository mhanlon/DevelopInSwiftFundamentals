 ## App Exercise - Movements
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Suppose your app contains a list of different movements that can be tracked. You want to display each item in the list to the user. Use a for-in loop to loop through `movements` below and print each movement.

/*:
 Now suppose your app uses a dictionary to keep track of your average heart rate during each of the movements in `movements`. The keys correspond to the movements listed above, and the values correspond to the average heart rate that your fitness tracker has monitored during the given movement. Loop through `movementHeartRates` below, printing statements telling the user his/her average heart rate during each exercise.
