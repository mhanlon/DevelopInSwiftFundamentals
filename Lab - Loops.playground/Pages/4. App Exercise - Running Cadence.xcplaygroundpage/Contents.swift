 ## App Exercise - While Loops
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 You may want your fitness tracking app to help runners track and improve their cadence. Running cadence is the number of steps a runner takes in a minute. To help with this, you decide to let the user input a cadence, after which your app will play a sound at each interval they need to take another step.
 
 For this exercise, you'll simulate a "test run" of the cadence feature of your app. Use a while loop to print "Take a step" to the console 10 times. Once you've successfully printed "Take a step" to the console 10 times, add the following code to the end of your while loop: `Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 60/cadence)`. This will put a pause between each itertion of the while loop so that the print statements actually occur at the proper cadence.
 */
let cadence: Double = 180
var testSteps = 0

while testSteps < 10 {
    print("Take a step")
    testSteps += 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 60/cadence)
}
/*:
 Recreate the above cadence example using a repeat-while loop.
 */
testSteps = 0 

repeat {
    print("Take a step")
    testSteps += 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 60/cadence)
} while testSteps < 10
