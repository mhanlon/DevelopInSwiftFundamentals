 ## App Exercise - Workout Tracking
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Your fitness tracking app wouldn't be much of a fitness tracker if it couldn't help users track their workouts. In order to track a user's run, you'll need to have some kind of data structure that can hold information about the workout. For the sake of simplicity, you'll focus specifically on running workouts.
 
 Create a `RunningWorkout` struct. It should have variables properties for `distance`, `time`, and `elevation`. All three properties should have default values of 0.0.
 */
struct RunningWorkout {
    var distance = 0.0
    var time = 0.0
    var elevation = 0.0
}

/*:
 Create a variable instance of `RunningWorkout` called `firstRun` without supplying any arguments. Print out all three properties of `firstRun`. This is a good example of when using default values is appropriate, seeing as all running workouts start with a distance, time, and elevation change of 0.
 */
var firstRun = RunningWorkout()
print(firstRun.distance)
print(firstRun.time)
print(firstRun.elevation)
/*:
 Now imagine that throughout the course of the run, you go a distance of 2,396 meters in 15.3 minutes, and gain 94 meters of elevation. Update the values of `firstRun`'s properties accordingly. Print a statement about your run using the values of each property.
