 ## Exercise - Optionals
 
  >Throughout the exercises in this playground, you will be printing optional values. The Swift compiler will display a warning: "Expression implicitly coerced from `Int?` to Any". For the purposes of these exercises, you can ignore this warning.

 Imagine you have an app that asks the user to enter his/her age using the keyboard. When your app allows a user to input text, what is captured for you is given as a `String`. However, you want to store this information as an `Int`. Is it possible for the user to make a mistake and for the input to not match the type you want to store?
 
 Declare a constant `userInputAge` of type `String` and assign it "34e" to simulate a typo while typing age. Then declare a constant `userAge` of type `Int` and set its value using the `Int` initializer that takes an instance of `String` as input. Pass in `userInputAge` as the argument for the initializer. What error do you get?
*/
let userInputAge = "34"
//let userAge: Int = Int(userInputAge)
let userAge: Int? = Int(userInputAge)
//Int(userInputAge) is optional initializer so userAge have to be Int?
/*:
 Go back and change the type of `userAge` to `Int?`, and print the value of `userAge`. Why is `userAge`'s value `nil`? Provide your answer in a comment or print statement below.
 */
print(userAge ?? "failed convert string to int")
//userAge is nil if userInputAge is 34e because It can't be converted into Int because of e in 34e
/*:
 Now go back and fix the typo on the value of `userInputAge`. Is there anything about the value printed that seems off?
 
 Print `userAge` again, but this time unwrap `userAge` using the force unwrap operator.
 */
print(userAge!)

/*:
 Now use optional binding to unwrap `userAge`. If `userAge` has a value, print it to the console.
 */
if let userAge = userAge {
    print(userAge)
}
