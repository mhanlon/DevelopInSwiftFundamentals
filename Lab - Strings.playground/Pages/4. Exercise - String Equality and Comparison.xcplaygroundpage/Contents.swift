 ## Exercise - String Equality and Comparison
 
 Create two constants, `nameInCaps` and `name`. Assign `nameInCaps` your name as a string literal with proper capitalization. Assign `name` your name as a string literal in all lowercase. Write an if-else statement that checks to see if `nameInCaps` and `name` are the same. If they are, print "The two strings are equal", otherwise print "The two strings are not equal."

} else {
    print("The two strings are not equal")
}
/*:
 Write a new if-else statement that also checks to see if `nameInCaps` and `name` are the same. However, this time use the `lowercased()` method on each constant to compare the lowercase version of the strings. If they are equal, print the following statement using string interpolations:
 
 - "<INSERT LOWERCASED VERSION OF `nameInCaps` HERE> and <INSERT LOWERCASED VERSION OF `name` HERE> are the same."
 
 If they are not equal, print the following statement using string interpolation:
 
 - "<INSERT LOWERCASED VERSION OF `nameInCaps` HERE> and <INSERT LOWERCASED VERSION OF `name` HERE> are not the same."

 Suppose you are trying to find a document on your computer that contains Hamlet's famous soliloquy written by Shakespeare. You write a simple app that will check every document to see if it contains the phrase "to be, or not to be". You decide to do part of this with the `contains(_:)` method. Write an if statement below that will check if `textToSearchThrough` contains `textToSearchFor`. If it does, print "I found it!" Be sure to make this functionality case insensitive.
