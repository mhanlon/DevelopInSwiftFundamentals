 ## App Exercise - Step Competition

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Below is a `User` struct and three `User` instances. These will be used throughout the exercises below to simulate competition in the fitness tracking app.

/*:
 The function below takes an array of `User` objects and returns the `User` object that has taken the most steps. The body of the function first declares a variable that is an optional `User`, then loops through all of the users in the array. Inside each iteration of the loop, it will check if `topCompetitor` has a value or not by unwrapping it. If `topCompetitor` doesn't have a value, then the current user in the iteration is assumed to have the highest score and is assigned to `topCompetitor`. If `topCompetitor` has a value, there is code to check whether the current user in the iteration has taken more steps than the user that is assigned to `topCompetitor`.

 At that point, the goal is to assign the user with the higher score to `topCompetitor`. However, the code generates a compiler error because, due to improper variable shadowing, `topCompetitor` has a narrower scope than it should if it is going to be reassigned. Fix the compiler error below and call `getWinner(competitors:)`, passing in the array `competitors`. Print the `name` property of the returned `User` object. You'll know that you fixed the function properly if the user returned is `activeSitter`.

 Write a memberwise initializer inside the `User` struct above that uses variable shadowing for naming the parameters of the initializer.

/*:
 Now write a failable initializer inside the `User` struct above that takes parameters `name` and `stepsToday` as an optional `String` and `Int`, respectively. The initializer should return `nil` if either of the parameters are `nil`. Use variable shadowing when unwrapping the two parameters.
