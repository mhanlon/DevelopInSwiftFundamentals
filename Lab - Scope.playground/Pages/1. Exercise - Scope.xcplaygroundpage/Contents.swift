## Exercise - Scope
 
 Using a comment or print statement, describe why the code below will generate a compiler error if you uncomment line 10.
 */
for _ in 0..<10 {
    let foo = 55
    print("The value of foo is \(foo)")
}
//print("The value of foo is \(foo)")

print("""
The 'foo' variable (and its value) is available only for the for loop scope. Every attempt to use it outside of it in the above example will result in an error.
""")
//:  Using a comment or print statement, describe why both print statements below compile when similar-looking code did not compile above. In what scope is `x` defined, and in what scope is it modified? In contrast, in what scope is `foo` defined and used?
var x = 10
for _ in 0..<10 {
    x += 1
    print("The value of x is \(x)")
}
print("The final value of x is \(x)")

print("""
Here the x variable has been defined in the global scope. Therefore it is available for use both in the global scope and inside a for loop.

The foo variable, however, is defined and can only be used inside the for loop.

//:  In the body of the function `greeting` below, use variable shadowing when unwrapping `greeting`. If `greeting` is successfully unwrapped, print a statement that uses the given greeting to greet the given name (i.e. if `greeting` successfully unwraps to have the value "Hi there" and `name` is `Sara`, print "Hi there, Sara."). Otherwise, use "Hello" to print a statement greeting the given name. Call the function twice, once passing in a value for greeting, and once passing in `nil`.
func greeting(greeting: String?, name: String) {
    var statement = ""
    if let greeting = greeting {
        statement = greeting
    } else {
        statement = "Hello"
    }
    statement += ", \(name)"
    print(statement)
}

greeting(greeting: nil, name: "Kacper")
//:  Create a class called `Car`. It should have properties for `make`, `model`, and `year` that are of type `String`, `String`, and `Int`, respectively. Since this is a class, you'll need to write your own memberwise initializer. Use shadowing when naming parameters in your initializer.
class Car {
    var make: String
    var model: String
    var year: Int
    
    init(make: String, model: String, year: Int) {
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
