 Using a comment or print statement, describe why both print statements below compile when similar-looking code did not compile above. In what scope is `x` defined, and in what scope is it modified? In contrast, in what scope is `foo` defined and used?

 In the body of the function `greeting` below, use variable shadowing when unwrapping `greeting`. If `greeting` is successfully unwrapped, print a statement that uses the given greeting to greet the given name (i.e. if `greeting` successfully unwraps to have the value "Hi there" and `name` is `Sara`, print "Hi there, Sara."). Otherwise, use "Hello" to print a statement greeting the given name. Call the function twice, once passing in a value for greeting, and once passing in `nil`.
