 ## App Exercise - Guard

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 In the exercises on optionals, you created a failable initializer for a `Workout` struct that would only initialize a `Workout` object if the `startTime` and `endTime` were further apart than 10 seconds. You'll now create the same failable initializer, only using a guard statement to check that the start and end times aren't too close together.

 Create a `Workout` struct that has properties `startTime` and `endTime` of type `Double`. Dates are difficult to work with, so you'll be using doubles to represent the number of seconds since midnight, i.e. 28800 would represent 28,800 seconds, which is exactly 8 hours, so the time would be 8am.

 Write a failable initializer that takes parameters for your start and end times, and then checks to see if they are greater than 10 seconds apart using a guard statement. If they are, your initializer should fail. Otherwise, the initializer should set the properties accordingly.
 */
struct Workout {
    var startTime: Double
    var endTime: Double

    init?(startTime: Double, endTime: Double) {
        guard endTime - startTime > 10 else { return nil }

        self.startTime = startTime
        self.endTime = endTime
    }
}
/*:
 Imagine a screen where a user inputs a meal that they've eaten. If the user taps a "save" button without adding any food, you might want to prompt the user that they haven't actually added anything.

 Using the `Food` struct and the text fields provided below, create a function called `logFood` that takes no parameters and returns an optional `Food` object. Inside the body of the function, use a guard statement to unwrap the `text` property of `foodTextField` and `caloriesTextField`. In addition to unwrapping `caloriesTextField`, you'll need to create and unwrap a new variable that initializes an `Int` from the text in `caloriesTextField`. If any of this fails, return `nil`. After the guard statement, create and return a `Food` object.
 */
struct Food {
    var name: String
    var calories: Int
}

let foodTextField = UITextField()
let caloriesTextField = UITextField()

foodTextField.text = "Banana"
caloriesTextField.text = "23"

func logFood() -> Food? {
    guard let foodName = foodTextField.text,
        let caloriesText = caloriesTextField.text,
        let calories = Int(caloriesText) else {
            return nil
    }

    return Food(name: foodName, calories: calories)
}
/*:
 Call the function you made above and capture the return value. Unwrap the `Food` object with standard optional binding and print a statement about the food using each of its properties. Go back and change the text in `caloriesTextField` to a string that cannot be converted into a number. What happens in that case?
 */
if let food = logFood() {
    print("\(food.name) -> \(food.calories) calories.")
}
//if caloriesTextField is string that cannot be converted into a number we can't create food object so nothing append
