 ## Exercise - Type Inference and Required Values
 
 Declare a variable called `name` of type `String`, but do not give it a value. Print `name` to the console. Does the code compile? Remove any code that will not compile.

var myVar: String

/*:
 Now assign a value to `name`, and print it to the console.

/*:
 Declare a variable called `distanceTraveled` and set it to 0. Do not give it an explicit type.
 */
var distanceTraveled: Double = 0

/*:
 Now assign a value of 54.3 to `distanceTraveled`. Does the code compile? Go back and set an explicit type on `distanceTraveled` so the code will compile.
 */
