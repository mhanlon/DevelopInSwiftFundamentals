 Now assign a value to `name`, and print it to the console.

 Declare a variable called `distanceTraveled` and set it to 0. Do not give it an explicit type.

 Now assign a value of 54.3 to `distanceTraveled`. Does the code compile? Go back and set an explicit type on `distanceTraveled` so the code will compile.
