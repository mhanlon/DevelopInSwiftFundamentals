/*:
 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Roberta"
print ("the name is a constant because it won't change")
var age = 28
print("the age inherently variable trait")
var numberOfStepsTaken = 2000
print ("the number of steps can change over throughout the day so that's why it's a variable")
let goalStepsNumber = 10000
print("the goal set of number won't change ")
var avarageHeartRate = 80
print ("the heart beat will be constantly updated that's why it's a variable")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
