/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 55 //number of facebook friends
print("friends") // output to the terminal


/*:
 Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
 */
// friends = friends -1
// cant do the above its a constant
// added comment to test git
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
 */
print("you cannot change the value of a constant\nInstead use var to declare it if you want it to be variable")
//note the use of the escape \n to add a new line within the string
