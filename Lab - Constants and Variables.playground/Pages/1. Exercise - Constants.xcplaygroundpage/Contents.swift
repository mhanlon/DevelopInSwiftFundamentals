/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 500

/*:
 Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
 */
let friends=100

/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
 */
print("The code does not compile because the variable friends is a constant")
