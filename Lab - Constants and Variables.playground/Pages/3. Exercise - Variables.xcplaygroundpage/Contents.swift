 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 5
print(schooling)

/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling += 1
print(schooling)
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("Works, because value of variable can be updated !")
