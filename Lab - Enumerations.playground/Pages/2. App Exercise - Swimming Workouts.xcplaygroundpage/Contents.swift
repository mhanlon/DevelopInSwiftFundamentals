## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.
 */
/* struct SwimmingWorkout {
    let distance: Double
    let time: Double
    let stroke: String
} */

//:  Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.
/* struct SwimmingWorkout {
    enum Stroke {
        case freestyle
        case butterfly
        case backstroke
        case breakstroke
    }
    
    let distance: Double
    let time: Double
    let stroke: Stroke
} */
let firstSwimmingWorkout = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 77, time: 600, stroke: .freestyle)
let secondSwimmingWorkout = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 78, time: 580, stroke: .butterfly)
//:  Now imagine you want to log swimming workouts separately based on the swimming stroke. You might use arrays as static variables on `SwimmingWorkout` for this. Add four static variables, `freestyleWorkouts`, `butterflyWorkouts`, `backstrokeWorkouts`, and `breaststrokeWorkouts`, to `SwimmingWorkout` above. Each should be of type `[SwimmingWorkout]` and should default to empty arrays.
//struct SwimmingWorkout {
//    enum Stroke {
//        case freestyle
//        case butterfly
//        case backstroke
//        case breakstroke
//    }
//
//    let distance: Double
//    let time: Double
//    let stroke: Stroke
//
//    static var freestyleWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
//    static var butterflyWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
//    static var backstrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
//    static var breakstrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
//}

//:  Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save()` method works properly.
struct SwimmingWorkout {
    enum Stroke {
        case freestyle
        case butterfly
        case backstroke
        case breakstroke
    }
    
    let distance: Double
    let time: Double
    let stroke: Stroke
    
    static var freestyleWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var butterflyWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var backstrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var breakstrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    
    func save() {
        switch stroke {
        case .freestyle:
            SwimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts.append(self)
        case .butterfly:
            SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts.append(self)
        case .backstroke:
            SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts.append(self)
        case .breakstroke:
            SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts.append(self)
        }
    }
}

firstSwimmingWorkout.save()
secondSwimmingWorkout.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts)
print(SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts)
