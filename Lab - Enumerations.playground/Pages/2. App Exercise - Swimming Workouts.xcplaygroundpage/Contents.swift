 ## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.
 */
struct SwimmingWorkout {
    enum Stroke {
        case freestyle
        case butterfly
        case backstroke
        case breaststroke
    }

    static var freestyleWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var butterflyWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var backstrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []
    static var breaststrokeWorkouts: [SwimmingWorkout] = []

    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var stroke: Stroke

    func save() {
        switch stroke {
        case .freestyle:
            SwimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts.append(self)
        case .butterfly:
            SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts.append(self)
        case .backstroke:
            SwimmingWorkout.backstrokeWorkouts.append(self)
        case .breaststroke:
            SwimmingWorkout.breaststrokeWorkouts.append(self)
        }
    }
}
/*:
 Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.
 */
let backstrokeSwim = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 500, time: 3000, stroke: .backstroke)
let breaststrokeSwim = SwimmingWorkout(distance: 500, time: 3400, stroke: .breaststroke)
/*:
 Now imagine you want to log swimming workouts separately based on the swimming stroke. You might use arrays as static variables on `SwimmingWorkout` for this. Add four static variables, `freestyleWorkouts`, `butterflyWorkouts`, `backstrokeWorkouts`, and `breaststrokeWorkouts`, to `SwimmingWorkout` above. Each should be of type `[SwimmingWorkout]` and should default to empty arrays.
 */


/*:
 Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save()` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save()` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save` method works properly.
 */
backstrokeSwim.save()
breaststrokeSwim.save()
print(SwimmingWorkout.freestyleWorkouts)
print(SwimmingWorkout.butterflyWorkouts)
