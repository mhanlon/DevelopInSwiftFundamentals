 ## Exercise - Switch Statements
 
 Imagine you're on a baseball team nearing the end of the season. Create a `leaguePosition` constant with a value of 1. Using a `switch` statement, print "Champions!" if the `leaguePosition` is 1, "Runners up" if the value is 2, "Third place" if the value is 3, and "Bad season!" in all other cases.
 */


/*:
 Write a new `switch` statement that prints "Medal winner" if `leaguePosition` is within the range of 1-3. Otherwise, print "No medal awarded".
