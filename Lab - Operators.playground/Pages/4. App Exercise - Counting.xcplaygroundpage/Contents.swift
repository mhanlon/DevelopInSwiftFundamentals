 ## App Exercise - Counting
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 The most basic feature of your fitness tracking app is counting steps. Create a variable `steps` and set it equal to 0. Then increment its value by 1 to simulate a user taking a step.
 */
var steps = 0
steps += 1
/*:
 In addition to tracking steps, your fitness tracking app tracks distance traveled. Create a variable `distance` of type `Double` and set it equal to 50. This will represent the user having traveled 50 feet.
 
 You decide, however, to display the distance in meters. 1 meter is approximately equal to 3 feet. Use a compound assignment operator to convert `distance` to meters. Print the result.
 */
var distance: Double = 50
distance /= 3
print(distance)
