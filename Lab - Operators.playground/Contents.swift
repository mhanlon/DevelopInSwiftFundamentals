 **Lab - Operators**
 
 Create two constants, `width` and `height`, with values of 100 and 250, respectively. Create an `area` constant that is the result of multiplying the two previous constants together, and print out the result.

/*:
 Create a `perimeter` constant whose value equals `width` plus `width` plus `height` plus `height`, then print out the result.
 */


/*:
 Print out what you think 10 + 2 * 5 evaluates to. Then print out the actual expression (i.e. `print(10 + 2 * 5)`)
 */


/*:
 In a separate statement, add in the necessary parentheses so that addition takes place before multiplication.
 */


/*:
 Create a constant, `divisionResult` that is the result of 10 divided by 3, and print the value.
 */


/*:
 Create a constant, `moreAccurateResult`, that is also the result of 10 divided by 3, but includes the repeating decimal. Print this value.
 */


/*:
 Given the value pi (3.1415927), create a `radius` constant with a value of 5.0, then calculate the diameter and circumference of the circle using the following equations, and print the results:

 *diameter = 2 * radius*
 
 *circumference = 2 * pi * radius.*
 */


/*:
 Declare a variable whose value begins at 10. Using addition, update the value to 15 using the compound assignment operator. Using multiplication, update the value to 30 using compound assignment. Print out the variable's value after each assignment.
 */


/*:
 Create an integer constant with a value of 10, and a double constant with a value of 3.2. Cast the `Double` to an `Int`, then multiply it by the integer constant and print out the value.
 */


/*:
 Create an integer constant. It's value should be equal to the remainder of 12 divided by 5. Do this using the modulus operator.
